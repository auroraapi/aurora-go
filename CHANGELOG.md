# Aurora GO SDK: Changelog

This Changelog is based off of [keep a better changelog](https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Releases are versioned on a week-by-week basis, ending on the date listed in the title. For example a version with date `2017-02-09` means the changes made from `2017-02-03` to that date are included in that section.

Each release should have the following sections:
- Added: what was added in this release
- Changed: what was changed (possibly breaking) in this release
- Deprecated: what will be removed in a future release and how to update your apps
- Fixed: issues that were fixed in this release
- Security: specifically security issues that were fixed in this release
